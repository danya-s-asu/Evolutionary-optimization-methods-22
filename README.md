# Evolutionary-optimization-methods-22
A selection of works in the course of studying genetic and evolutionary algorithms for solving a problem using the [DEAP](https://github.com/DEAP/deap) package

[DEAP](https://github.com/DEAP/deap) is a novel evolutionary computation framework for rapid prototyping and testing of ideas. It seeks to make algorithms explicit and data structures transparent.

lab1 - A simple [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) on the example of solving a problem optimization of a one-dimensional function $Cos(2x)/x^2$ and $x\in[-20,-2.3]$ 

lab2 - Optimization of multivariate [Rosenbrock](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/api/benchmarks.html#deap.benchmarks.rosenbrock) functions $f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} (1-x_i)^2 + 100 (x_{i+1} - x_i^2 )^2$ 

lab3 - Solving the [Traveling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) ["eil51"](http://elib.zib.de/pub/mp-testdata/tsp/tsplib/tsp/eli51.tsp) with the help of genetic algorithms
